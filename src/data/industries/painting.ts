  // TL;DR
  tldr: 'Painting contractor SEO helps painters rank higher for residential and commercial projects where visual proof of quality is essential. With 87% of homeowners researching contractors online and project values ranging from $2,000-$15,000+, SEO that showcases portfolio quality while building trust generates leads at 50-60% lower cost than paid advertising.',

  // Definition section
  definition: {
    direct:
      'Painting contractor SEO is the practice of optimizing a painting company\'s online presence to rank higher in search results for residential, commercial, and specialty painting queries. This includes Google Business Profile optimization, portfolio-driven content, review management, and visual-first website design.',

    expanded:
      'For painting contractors, SEO success depends heavily on visual proof—homeowners want to see work quality before hiring. The $45+ billion painting services market is competitive, with large franchises like CertaPro and Five Star dominating brand searches. Effective painting SEO differentiates through portfolio quality, customer testimonials, and specialty service positioning (cabinet painting, exterior restoration, commercial work). Project timelines of 1-3 weeks make customer acquisition cost particularly important for profitability.',
