  // TL;DR
  tldr: 'Pest control SEO helps exterminators rank higher for seasonal pest searches, emergency infestations, and recurring service queries. With 93% of consumers reading reviews before hiring and 68% of searches happening on mobile, strong local SEO combined with seasonal content strategy is essential for sustainable lead generation.',

  // Definition section
  definition: {
    direct:
      'Pest control SEO is the practice of optimizing an exterminator\'s online presence to rank higher in search results for pest-related queries. This includes Google Business Profile optimization, seasonal pest content strategy, emergency visibility for infestations, and review management to build trust.',

    expanded:
      'For pest control companies, SEO success depends on anticipating seasonal pest cycles. Ant and roach searches spike in summer, rodent searches surge in winter, and termite searches peak during spring swarms. With 32,000+ pest control companies nationwide competing for the same searches, timing content to rank before seasonal spikes separates successful companies from those scrambling to buy expensive ads. The recurring service model makes customer lifetime value high, making organic lead acquisition particularly valuable.',

  // Strategies
  strategies: [
    {
      title: 'Build Seasonal Content Before Peak Season',
      why: 'Content needs 2-3 months to rank. Publishing ant control content in July is too late—publish in March-April.',
      steps: [
        'Create pest-specific content calendars aligned with seasonal cycles',

  // FAQs
  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How much does pest control SEO cost?',
      answer:
        'Pest control SEO typically costs $1,500-$3,500 per month depending on market size and competition. Markets with year-round pest pressure may require more investment. Most pest control companies see positive ROI within 6-9 months through reduced ad spend.',
      category: 'cost',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does pest control SEO take to work?',
      answer:
        'Most pest control companies see initial improvements in 3-4 months, with significant results at 6-12 months. Seasonal content should be published 2-3 months before pest season to rank when searches spike.',
      category: 'timeline',
    },
    {
      question: 'What pest control keywords should I target?',
      answer:
        'Target specific pest keywords (bed bug treatment, termite inspection) rather than generic "pest control." Also focus on emergency keywords (24 hour exterminator) and location-modified terms ([city] exterminator). Specific keywords have lower competition.',
      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'How important are reviews for pest control SEO?',
      answer:
        'Reviews are critical—93% of consumers read reviews before hiring pest control. Focus on quantity (aim for 100+), recency (steady monthly reviews), and responding to every review. Reviews mentioning specific pests improve keyword relevance.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I handle seasonal pest demand with SEO?',
      answer:
        'Create seasonal pest content 2-3 months before each pest season. Publish ant/roach content in spring, rodent content in late summer, and termite content before swarm season. Update content annually with fresh statistics.',
      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should pest control companies target bed bug keywords?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Bed bug treatment has high intent and good margins. Create dedicated bed bug pages with treatment process, cost information, and FAQ content. These customers often need immediate help and are less price-sensitive.',
      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I rank for pest control in multiple cities?',
      answer:
        'Create unique location pages for each city with genuine local content. Include local pest patterns (regional pests), testimonials from that area, and specific service availability. Focus on 3-5 highest-opportunity cities first.',
      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is GEO and why does it matter for pest control?',
      answer:
        'GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) optimizes your content for AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. As more homeowners ask AI about pest identification and treatment, companies not optimized for GEO become invisible to these searchers.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I get more pest control reviews?',
      answer:
        'Request reviews immediately after successful treatment. Use automated text follow-ups with direct Google review links. Frame requests around helping others with similar pest problems to reduce privacy concerns. Respond to every review professionally.',

    },
    {
      question: 'Can I do pest control SEO myself?',
      answer:
        'Basic optimizations like GBP management and review generation can be handled in-house. However, seasonal content strategy, technical SEO, and competitive analysis typically require expertise. Most pest control companies find professional help more cost-effective.',
      category: 'cost',

      question: 'What makes a good pest control website for SEO?',
      answer:
        'Fast load times (under 3 seconds), mobile-first design, clear service pages for each pest type, location pages, trust signals (reviews, licenses, certifications), and prominent phone numbers. Avoid using pest images on the homepage.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I track ROI on pest control SEO?',
      answer:
        'Track organic traffic growth by season, keyword rankings for target pests, GBP calls, and form submissions from organic search. Compare cost per lead and customer lifetime value from organic versus paid channels.',
