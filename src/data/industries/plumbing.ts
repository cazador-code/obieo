  // TL;DR
  tldr: 'Plumbing SEO helps plumbing companies rank higher for emergency and residential searches, generating leads without expensive pay-per-click costs. With 76% of local searchers not having a specific company in mind, ranking in the local 3-pack is essential for capturing homeowners at the moment of need.',

  // Definition section
  definition: {
    direct:
      'Plumbing SEO is the practice of optimizing a plumbing company\'s online presence to rank higher in search results for plumbing-related queries. This includes Google Business Profile optimization, emergency service visibility, review management, and creating content that answers common plumbing questions.',

    expanded:
      'For plumbers, SEO success depends on capturing both planned and emergency searches. Emergency plumbing calls often go to whoever appears first—76% of searchers don\'t have a specific company in mind. Unlike home projects that homeowners research for weeks, plumbing emergencies require immediate response. Effective plumbing SEO builds visibility for both emergency keywords and longer-term research queries like "water heater replacement cost," capturing customers at every stage of the decision process.',

  // FAQs
  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How much does plumbing SEO cost?',
      answer:
        'Plumbing SEO typically costs $1,500-$4,000 per month depending on market competitiveness and service scope. Smaller markets may see results with $1,500-$2,000/month, while competitive metro areas often require $2,500-$4,000/month. Most plumbers see positive ROI within 6-9 months.',
      category: 'cost',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does plumbing SEO take to work?',
      answer:
        'Most plumbing companies see initial improvements in 3-4 months, with significant results at 6-12 months. Emergency service pages often rank faster due to clear search intent. Local pack rankings typically improve faster than organic listings.',
      category: 'timeline',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should plumbers use SEO or Google Ads?',
      answer:
        'Both have value, but SEO provides better long-term ROI. Start with SEO as your foundation for consistent visibility, then use Google Ads to fill gaps or during slow periods. Many successful plumbers reduce ad spend by 40-60% after establishing strong SEO.',
      category: 'comparison',
    },
    {
      question: 'What keywords should plumbers target?',
      answer:
        'Focus on emergency keywords (emergency plumber, 24 hour plumbing), location-specific terms ([city] plumber), and service-specific keywords (water heater installation). Also target long-tail brand keywords (Rheem water heater repair) which have less competition.',
      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'How important are reviews for plumbing SEO?',
      answer:
        'Reviews are critical—93% of consumers read reviews before hiring a plumber, and reviews influence 36% of local rankings. Focus on quantity (aim for 100+), recency (steady stream monthly), and responding to every review within 24 hours.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I compete with plumbing franchises in SEO?',
      answer:
        'Franchises win on brand recognition but often rank poorly for specific neighborhoods and services. Create hyper-local content for suburbs they ignore, build stronger review velocity, and target specific service keywords like brand-specific repairs.',
      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need a new website for plumbing SEO?',
      answer:
        'Not necessarily. Many existing websites can be optimized without rebuilding. Key requirements are mobile responsiveness, fast load times, and proper on-page elements. A complete rebuild may be needed if your site is very slow or on a limiting platform.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I rank for plumbing in multiple cities?',
      answer:
        'Create unique location pages for each city with genuine local content—not just swapped city names. Include local testimonials, project photos from that area, and neighborhood-specific information. Focus on your 3-5 highest-opportunity cities first.',
      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is GEO and why does it matter for plumbers?',
      answer:
        'GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) optimizes your content for AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. As more homeowners ask AI for plumbing recommendations, companies not optimized for GEO become invisible. Key tactics include cited statistics and authoritative content.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I track ROI on plumbing SEO?',
      answer:
        'Track organic traffic growth, keyword rankings, GBP calls, and form submissions from organic search. Compare cost per lead from organic versus paid channels. Well-executed plumbing SEO typically achieves 50-70% lower cost per lead than Google Ads.',
      category: 'cost',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I do plumbing SEO myself?',
      answer:
        'Basic optimizations like GBP management and review generation can be handled in-house. However, technical SEO, content strategy, and competitive analysis typically require expertise. Most plumbers find their time better spent on service calls while professionals handle SEO.',
      category: 'cost',
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes a good plumbing website for SEO?',
      answer:
        'Fast load times (under 3 seconds), mobile-first design, clear service pages, location pages, prominent phone numbers for emergencies, and trust signals (reviews, licenses, insurance). Technical requirements include proper schema markup and secure HTTPS.',
