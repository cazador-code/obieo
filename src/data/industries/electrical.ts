  // TL;DR - starts with target keyword, highly quotable for AI citation
  tldr: 'Electrician SEO is the most cost-effective way for electrical contractors to generate consistent, high-quality leads online. With the average cost per lead from SEO at $40-$120 compared to $125-$350 from paid ads, electricians who invest in search optimization see 3-5x better ROI within 12 months. As AI Overviews now answer 16% of searches directly, optimizing for both Google and AI-powered search engines is essential for capturing electrical leads in 2026.',

      'Electrician SEO is the process of optimizing an electrical contracting business\'s website, Google Business Profile, and online presence to rank higher in search results for electrical service queries. It encompasses local SEO, technical optimization, content creation for high-value services like EV charger installation and panel upgrades, and AI search optimization.',

    // ~140 words - within 100-150 target
    expanded:
      'Electrician SEO differs from general SEO because electrical contractors face unique challenges: emergency service searches require instant visibility, high-value services like EV charger installation (35,000 monthly searches, KD 5) demand specialized content, and licensing trust signals directly impact conversion rates. The electrical services market exceeds $225 billion in the U.S., yet most electricians rely entirely on paid advertising or word-of-mouth. According to BrightLocal, 87% of consumers used Google to evaluate local businesses in 2024, and 76% of local searchers visit a business within 24 hours. For electricians, SEO success depends on capturing both traditional search rankings and AI-generated responses, which now influence an estimated 16% of desktop searches. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) ensures electricians are cited as authoritative sources in AI Overviews and chatbot responses.',

      question: 'How much does electrician SEO cost?',
      answer:
        'Electrician SEO typically costs $1,500-$4,000 per month depending on market size, competition, and scope of services. Markets with high EV adoption or multiple service areas may require more investment. Most electrical contractors see positive ROI within 6-9 months, with cost per lead dropping to $40-$120 compared to $125-$350 from paid ads.',
      category: 'cost',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does electrician SEO take to work?',
      answer:
        'Most electricians see initial ranking improvements in 3-4 months, with significant lead generation at 6-12 months. Low-competition niches like EV charger installation content can rank within weeks. Emergency service pages typically improve faster than general service pages because they target high-intent, specific queries.',

      question: 'What is the ROI of electrician SEO?',
      answer:
        'Well-executed electrician SEO delivers a 3-5x return on investment within 12 months. The average organic lead costs $40-$120, compared to $125-$350 from paid ads. Unlike advertising, SEO compounds over time — month 12 generates significantly more leads than month 1 at the same investment level. Most electricians recoup their SEO investment by month 6-9.',

    {
      question: 'Should electricians focus on EV charger SEO?',
      answer:
        'Yes, EV charger installation is the single biggest SEO opportunity for electricians today. It has 35,000 monthly searches with keyword difficulty of only 5 out of 100, meaning even new websites can rank.

      question: 'How do I rank for electrical services in multiple cities?',
      answer:
        'Create unique, substantive location pages for each city with genuine local content — real project photos from that area, customer testimonials with city names, and local electrical code references. Avoid thin, duplicated pages that just swap city names. Focus on your 3-5 highest-opportunity cities first, then expand as those pages gain traction.',

      question: 'Should electricians create smart home content?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Smart home technology creates new, higher-margin service opportunities and positions you as a technology expert rather than a commodity tradesperson. Build content for specific ecosystems (Lutron, Control4, Savant) and services like whole-home automation wiring. Smart home device installations are growing 40% annually, creating significant search demand.',

      question: 'What makes a good electrician website for SEO?',
      answer:
        'A high-performing electrician website needs fast load times (under 3 seconds), mobile-first responsive design, dedicated service pages for each offering (EV chargers, panel upgrades, etc.), prominent license and insurance display, emergency contact visibility above the fold, trust signals (reviews, certifications), and proper technical SEO including schema markup, HTTPS, and optimized Core Web Vitals.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I track ROI on electrician SEO?',
      answer:
        'Track organic traffic growth in Google Analytics, keyword ranking positions in tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush, Google Business Profile calls and direction requests, form submissions attributed to organic search, and phone calls from organic landing pages using call tracking. Compare your organic cost per lead ($40-$120) against paid channels ($125-$350) monthly to quantify ROI.',

    {
      question: 'How do I display licenses and certifications for SEO benefit?',
      answer:
        'Display license numbers on every page footer, create a dedicated credentials and about page, add license information to your Google Business Profile description, mention certifications in review responses, and use schema markup (hasCredential, qualifications) to help search engines understand your qualifications. This directly improves E-E-A-T signals.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is electrician SEO better than Google Ads?',
      answer:
        'Electrician SEO and Google Ads serve different purposes. SEO delivers lower cost per lead ($40-$120 vs $125-$350), compounds over time, and captures research-phase leads months before they are ready to buy. Ads deliver immediate results but stop generating leads when the budget runs out. The best strategy combines both: use ads for immediate lead flow while building long-term SEO assets.',
      category: 'comparison',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between electrician SEO and general SEO?',
      answer:
        'Electrician SEO focuses on industry-specific factors: emergency service visibility requiring 24/7 schema, license and certification trust signals critical for electrical safety, service-area targeting for local pack rankings, seasonal content strategies aligned with electrical demand cycles, and specialized keyword targeting for high-value services like EV charger installation and panel upgrades.',
