  // TL;DR
  tldr: 'Garage door SEO helps repair companies rank higher for emergency searches where the first 10 minutes determine who gets the job. With 76% of local searchers taking action within 24 hours and garage door emergencies requiring immediate response, ranking in the local 3-pack is essential for capturing $500-$2,000 per-job revenue.',

  // Definition section
  definition: {
    direct:
      'Garage door SEO is the practice of optimizing a garage door company\'s online presence to rank higher in search results for repair, installation, and emergency service queries. This includes Google Business Profile optimization, emergency service visibility, voice search optimization, and mobile-first website performance.',

    expanded:
      'For garage door companies, SEO success depends on the first-responder advantage—the first company to answer often wins the job. Emergency repairs like broken springs and stuck doors require immediate response. Voice search is particularly important as homeowners often search hands-free while looking at a broken garage door. Mobile load speed is critical since 76% of searchers take action within 24 hours, and garage door emergencies often happen before work when people are rushing.',
