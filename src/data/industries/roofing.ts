  tldr: 'Roofing SEO combines local search optimization, storm-chaser defense strategies, and AI search visibility to help roofing companies generate consistent leads. With 87% of homeowners researching online before calling a roofer, ranking on Google and AI platforms like ChatGPT is essential for sustainable growth beyond paid ads.',

    direct:
      'Roofing SEO is the practice of optimizing a roofing company\'s online presence to rank higher in search engine results for roofing-related searches. This includes optimizing Google Business Profile, creating location-specific content, building local citations, managing reviews, and ensuring technical website performance.',

    // Expanded explanation (100-150 words)
    expanded:
      'For roofing contractors, SEO differs from other industries due to the high-ticket nature of services ($8,000-$25,000+ per job), extreme seasonal demand fluctuations, and intense competition from both local companies and storm chasers. Effective roofing SEO must account for emergency searches after weather events, insurance-related queries, and the research phase that 87% of homeowners go through before contacting a contractor. Unlike paid advertising that stops generating leads when you stop paying, SEO builds compounding organic visibility that generates leads month after month.',

  // FAQs (12-15 items)
  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How much does roofing SEO cost?',
      answer:
        'Roofing SEO typically costs $1,500-$5,000 per month depending on market competitiveness and service scope. Smaller markets may see results with $1,500-$2,500/month, while competitive metro areas often require $3,500-$5,000/month. The investment usually pays for itself within 6-12 months through reduced ad spend and increased organic leads.',
      category: 'cost',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does it take to see SEO results for roofing?',
      answer:
        'Most roofing companies see initial improvements in 3-4 months, with significant results at 6-12 months. Local pack rankings often improve faster than organic listings. Storm-related content may rank faster during active weather seasons due to search volume spikes.',
      category: 'timeline',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should roofers use SEO or Google Ads?',
      answer:
        'Both have value, but SEO provides better long-term ROI. Start with SEO as your foundation, then use Google Ads to supplement during slow seasons or while building organic visibility. Many successful roofers reduce ad spend by 50-70% after establishing strong SEO.',
      category: 'comparison',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I compete with storm chasers in SEO?',
      answer:
        'Storm chasers rarely invest in SEO because they move between markets. Build your organic presence before storm season with location-specific storm damage content. When storms hit, you\'ll already rank while they\'re scrambling to buy ads at inflated prices.',
      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'What keywords should roofers target?',
      answer:
        'Focus on high-intent local keywords like "roof replacement [city]," "roofing contractor near me," and emergency terms. Also target insurance-related long-tail keywords like "does insurance cover storm damage roof [state]" which have less competition and high conversion rates.',
      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'How important are Google reviews for roofing SEO?',
      answer:
        'Reviews are critical—they account for roughly 36% of local pack ranking factors. Focus on quantity (aim for 50+), recency (steady stream better than bursts), and keywords in responses. Reviews mentioning specific services and locations provide additional SEO value.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need a new website for roofing SEO?',
      answer:
        'Not necessarily. Many existing websites can be optimized without rebuilding. Key requirements are mobile responsiveness, fast load times, and proper on-page elements. A complete rebuild may be needed if your current site is slow, outdated, or built on a platform that limits SEO.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I rank for roofing in multiple cities?',
      answer:
        'Create unique location pages for each city with local content (testimonials, projects, weather info). Avoid duplicate content—each page needs genuine unique value. For distant cities outside your service area, focus on the 3-5 highest opportunity markets rather than trying to rank everywhere.',
      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is GEO and why does it matter for roofers?',
      answer:
        'GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) optimizes your content for AI search tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. As more homeowners ask AI for roofing recommendations, companies not optimized for GEO become invisible. Key tactics include structured data, cited statistics, and authoritative content.',
      category: 'technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I track ROI on roofing SEO?',
      answer:
        'Track organic traffic growth, keyword rankings, calls from Google Business Profile, and form submissions from organic search. Most importantly, track cost per lead from organic vs paid channels. Well-executed SEO typically achieves 50-70% lower cost per lead than Google Ads.',
      category: 'cost',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is roofing SEO worth it for small contractors?',
      answer:
        'Yes, often more so than for large companies. Small contractors can dominate specific neighborhoods or service niches that big players ignore. A focused SEO strategy targeting 3-5 nearby cities often outperforms broad campaigns spreading budget thin.',
      category: 'industry',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does roofing SEO differ from other contractor SEO?',
      answer:
        'Roofing SEO is uniquely affected by weather events, insurance complexity, and extreme seasonality. Storm preparation content, insurance carrier optimization, and emergency service visibility are roofing-specific strategies not needed in most other trades.',
      category: 'industry',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I do roofing SEO myself?',
      answer:
        'Basic optimizations like GBP management and review generation can be done in-house. However, technical SEO, content strategy, and competitive analysis typically require expertise. Many roofers find the time investment better spent on jobs while professionals handle SEO.',

      question: 'What makes a good roofing website for SEO?',
      answer:
        'Fast load times (under 3 seconds), mobile-first design, clear service pages, location pages, strong calls-to-action, and trust signals (reviews, certifications, insurance info). Technical requirements include proper schema markup, secure HTTPS, and clean URL structure.',
