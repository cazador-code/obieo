    'Roofing SEO strategies that generate consistent leads from Google, AI search, and local listings. Storm damage content, GBP optimization, and review tactics for roofers.',

  // Tracking
  lastUpdated: '2026-02-06',

  // TL;DR (2-3 sentences, CITABLE compliant)
  tldr: 'Roofing SEO is the most cost-effective way for roofing companies to generate consistent leads, reducing cost per lead by 50-70% compared to Google Ads. With 93% of homeowners starting their roofer search online and AI platforms like ChatGPT increasingly recommending contractors, ranking in both traditional and AI search is critical for roofing companies in 2026.',

  // Definition section
  definition: {
    // First 40-60 words - extractable definition for AI
    direct:
      'Roofing SEO is the process of optimizing a roofing company\'s website and online presence to rank higher in search engines for roofing-related queries. It encompasses Google Business Profile optimization, storm damage content creation, local citation building, review management, and technical site performance to generate organic leads.',

    // Expanded explanation (100-150 words)
    expanded:
      'Roofing SEO differs from general contractor SEO due to the industry\'s unique characteristics: high average job values ($8,000-$25,000+ per roof replacement), extreme seasonal and weather-driven demand fluctuations, and intense competition from both local companies and out-of-town storm chasers. The U.S. roofing market is valued at $56.7 billion and growing at 4.2% annually. Effective roofing SEO must capture emergency searches that spike 300-500% after storms, insurance-related research queries, and the extended consideration phase where 93% of homeowners compare contractors online. With roofing keywords costing $15-$45 per click in Google Ads, organic search delivers significantly better long-term ROI. Companies investing in roofing SEO typically see a 5:1 to 12:1 return within the first year.',

Smaller markets may see results with $1,500-$2,500/month, while competitive metro areas often require $3,500-$5,000/month.

      question: 'What is the average cost per lead for roofing companies?',
      answer:
        'Roofing cost per lead varies by channel: Google Ads averages $200-$500, SEO generates leads at $50-$150 (decreasing over time), and referrals cost near $0 but are limited in volume. Storm season inflates paid costs by 200-400%. SEO provides the most predictable and cost-effective lead generation long-term.',
