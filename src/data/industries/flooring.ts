  // TL;DR
  tldr: 'Flooring contractor SEO helps installers rank higher for hardwood, tile, carpet, and LVP installation searches where project values range from $3,000-$20,000+. With big box stores dominating product searches and 78% of homeowners researching online before purchasing, SEO that captures installation-intent searches generates leads at significantly lower cost than competing on product sales.',

  // Definition section
  definition: {
    direct:
      'Flooring contractor SEO is the practice of optimizing a flooring company\'s online presence to rank higher in search results for installation, repair, and refinishing queries. This includes Google Business Profile optimization, material-specific content, showroom visibility, and visual portfolio presentation.',

    expanded:
      'For flooring contractors, SEO success depends on capturing installation-intent searches rather than competing with Home Depot and Lowes for product searches. The $50+ billion flooring market sees contractors struggling against big box store SEO dominance. Effective flooring SEO focuses on installation expertise, local showroom visibility, and material-specific content that positions contractors as flooring experts—not just installers. High project values ($3,000-$20,000+) make customer acquisition cost critical for profitability.',
