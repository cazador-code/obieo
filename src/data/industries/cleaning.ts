  // TL;DR
  tldr: 'Cleaning services SEO helps house cleaners and maid services rank higher for local searches and compete with platforms like Thumbtack and Handy. With trust being paramount for in-home services and a single weekly client worth $5,000-$15,000 in lifetime value, SEO that builds credibility while generating leads is essential for sustainable growth.',

  // Definition section
  definition: {
    direct:
      'Cleaning services SEO is the practice of optimizing a cleaning company\'s online presence to rank higher in search results for house cleaning, maid service, and commercial cleaning queries. This includes Google Business Profile optimization, trust-building content, review management, and competing effectively against booking platforms.',

    expanded:
      'For cleaning companies, SEO success depends heavily on building trust—customers are inviting strangers into their homes. The $415+ billion global cleaning market is fiercely competitive, with platforms like Thumbtack and Handy dominating many search results. Effective cleaning services SEO must differentiate from commoditized platform listings through credibility signals like background checks, insurance, and consistent quality. The recurring nature of cleaning services makes customer acquisition particularly valuable, with a single weekly client generating $5,000-$15,000 in lifetime revenue.',
