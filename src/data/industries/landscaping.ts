  // TL;DR
  tldr: 'Landscaping SEO helps lawn care and landscaping companies rank higher for seasonal services, recurring maintenance, and design projects. With extreme seasonality and competition from solo operators, content marketing that educates on climate-specific care builds authority and generates leads at 62% lower cost than traditional marketing.',

  // Definition section
  definition: {
    direct:
      'Landscaping SEO is the practice of optimizing a landscaping company\'s online presence to rank higher in search results for lawn care, hardscaping, and landscape design queries. This includes Google Business Profile optimization, local climate-specific content, visual portfolio optimization, and seasonal service visibility.',

    expanded:
      'For landscaping companies, SEO success depends on building year-round visibility despite extreme seasonality. Companies that create climate-specific content (like "Lawn Care for Colorado\'s Clay Soil") face less competition than those targeting generic keywords. Visual content is particularly important—businesses with 100+ GBP photos receive 520% more calls. The recurring nature of lawn care makes customer acquisition through SEO particularly valuable, as each client represents years of repeat revenue.',

  // Strategies

    {
      title: 'Create Climate-Specific Content',
      why: 'Generic lawn care content faces massive competition. Climate-specific content like "Lawn Care for Arizona\'s Desert Climate" has lower competition and higher relevance.',
      steps: [
        'Research local soil types, climate zones, and common grass varieties',
        'Create guides addressing regional challenges (drought, clay soil, etc.)',

    },
    {
      title: 'Target Seasonal Keywords Early',
      why: 'Seasonal content needs 2-3 months to rank. Publishing spring cleanup content in April is too late.',

      question: 'How long does landscaping SEO take to work?',
      answer:
        'Most landscaping companies see initial improvements in 3-4 months, with significant results at 6-12 months. Seasonal content should be published 2-3 months before each season to rank when searches spike.',
      category: 'timeline',
    },
    {
      question: 'What landscaping keywords should I target?',
      answer:
        'Target service-specific keywords (lawn mowing, landscape design, patio installation), location terms ([city] landscaper), and climate-specific keywords (lawn care for [climate]). Specific keywords have lower competition than generic "landscaping."',

    {
      question: 'How important are photos for landscaping SEO?',
      answer:
        'Photos are critical—businesses with 100+ GBP photos receive 520% more calls and 1,065% more website clicks. Document every project with before/after photos and add them to both GBP and your website.',

    },
    {
      question: 'How do I handle seasonal demand with SEO?',

      category: 'strategy',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I create separate content for design and maintenance?',
      answer:

    {
      question: 'How do I compete with cheap solo operators?',
      answer:
