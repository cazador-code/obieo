**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Status:** In progress (brainstorming)

---

## What Was Done

- Started brainstorming session for SEO content strategy
- Reviewed current site structure: 4 blog posts, landing pages (AI visibility guide, ROI calculator, quiz), service/industry pages
- Established primary goal: **inbound leads** (attract contractors searching for marketing help)

## Key Decisions

- Focus on lead generation over brand awareness or thought leadership
- Content should target bottom-of-funnel, transactional intent keywords

## Next Steps

- Decide targeting scope: roofing only vs. all contractors vs. roofing + 2-3 adjacent trades
- Identify specific keywords to target
- Plan content calendar/priorities
