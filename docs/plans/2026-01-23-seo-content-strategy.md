## 4. Technical SEO Requirements

### Meta Tags (Per Page)

```tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: '[Industry] SEO Services | Obieo',
  description: '[150-160 char description with primary keyword]',
  keywords: ['[primary keyword]', '[secondary 1]', '[secondary 2]', '[location if applicable]'],
  openGraph: {
    title: '[Industry] SEO Services | Obieo',
    description: '[Same as meta description]',
    url: 'https://obieo.com/[industry]',
    siteName: 'Obieo',
    type: 'website',
  },
  twitter: {
    card: 'summary_large_image',
    title: '[Industry] SEO Services | Obieo',
    description: '[Same as meta description]',
  },
  alternates: {
    canonical: 'https://obieo.com/[industry]',
  },
}
```

### Schema Markup (JSON-LD)

Each industry page needs:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Service",
  "name": "[Industry] SEO Services",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Obieo",
    "url": "https://obieo.com"
  },
  "description": "[Service description]",
  "areaServed": "United States",
  "serviceType": "SEO Services"
}
```

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "[Question text]",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "[Answer text]"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sitemap Updates

Update `src/app/sitemap.ts` to explicitly include all industry pages:

```typescript
const industryPages = [
  'roofing', 'plumbing', 'hvac', 'electrical',
  'pest-control', 'landscaping', 'garage-doors',
  'painting', 'flooring', 'cleaning'
].map(industry => ({
  url: `https://www.obieo.com/${industry}`,
  lastModified: new Date(),
  changeFrequency: 'monthly' as const,
  priority: 0.9,
}))
```

---

## 5. Internal Linking Strategy

### Hub and Spoke Model

```
/industries (Hub)
    ├── /roofing (Spoke) ←→ /blog/roofing-seo-guide
    ├── /plumbing (Spoke) ←→ /blog/plumber-marketing-guide
    ├── /hvac (Spoke) ←→ /blog/hvac-marketing-guide
    └── ... (other spokes)
```

### Link Placement Rules

1. **From Blog Posts to Industry Pages:**
   - Every blog post mentions at least one industry
   - Use keyword-rich anchor text: "our roofing SEO services" not "click here"

2. **From Industry Pages to Blog Posts:**
   - "Learn more" sections linking to relevant guides
   - FAQ answers linking to detailed blog posts

3. **Cross-Industry Links:**
   - "We also work with [related industry]" sections
   - Case study references across pages

4. **From Homepage:**
   - Feature top 3 industries (Roofing, Plumbing, HVAC) in services section
   - Industry cards linking to individual pages

### Existing Blog Posts to Link

| Blog Post | Link To |
|-----------|---------|
| /blog/generative-engine-optimization-guide | All industry pages (GEO section) |
| /blog/ai-search-contractors | All industry pages, /services |
