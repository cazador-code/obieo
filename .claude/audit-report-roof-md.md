## Key Findings

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **Yelp Rating is 2.5 stars (4 reviews)** — This is a reputation killer. Anyone who checks Yelp will see a below-average rating with almost no reviews.

2. **BBB Rating is B- (Not Accredited)** — Has 1 unanswered complaint on file. "Not Accredited" status hurts credibility vs competitors with A+ ratings.

3. **Not appearing in "Best Memphis Roofers" lists** — Searched multiple sources (Expertise.com, Angi, HomeGuide, Yelp Top 10) and Roof MD does not appear in any top lists despite claiming "Memphis's Best Roofers."

4. **Review volume is critically low** — 4 Yelp reviews over 15 years = essentially no review strategy. Competitors like Masters Roofing and ContractingPRO have hundreds.

### Important Improvements

1. **Meta description not visible** — The homepage should have a compelling 150-160 character meta description. Currently unclear if one exists.

2. **Content is promotional, not educational** — Lots of "call now" CTAs but limited blog/educational content that would attract organic traffic.

3. **Schema markup is good but missing aggregateRating** — They have RoofingContractor and FAQPage schema, but no review ratings embedded in structured data.

4. **Service area pages are thin** — Lists 15+ cities but each likely needs dedicated landing pages with unique content.

### Quick Wins

1. **Respond to BBB complaint immediately** — This alone could improve their rating.

2. **Add aggregateRating to schema** — If they have ANY positive reviews, embed them.

3. **Update Expertise.com award** — They show "Best Memphis Roofing Company 2022" but it's now 2026. Either get a new award or remove outdated one.

4. **Fix email professionalism** — Contact email is gmancrocker@gmail.com. Should be info@roofmd.com for credibility.

## Competitive Landscape

**Top Memphis Roofing Competitors (2026):**

| Competitor | Differentiator | Why They Rank |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Masters Roofing | 6,000+ roofs installed, A+ BBB | Volume + reputation |
| ContractingPRO | A+ BBB, 20+ years | Strong authority signals |
| Restoration Roofing | "Highest rated in Memphis" claim | Aggressive positioning |
| Summit Roofing | 5.0 stars, insurance claim expertise | Review quality |

**What competitors do better:**
- Masters Roofing has BBB A+ accreditation and "6,000+ roofs" social proof
- ContractingPRO has A+ BBB + 20 years positioning
- Summit Roofing has perfect 5.0 star reviews

**Content gaps Roof MD could exploit:**
- None of the top competitors emphasize "Dr. Leaky" educational content angle
- The 21-point inspection process is a differentiator nobody else claims
- Military/Senior/First Responder discounts could be SEO targeted

## Sales Talking Points

Use these specific observations on demo calls:

1. **"Your Yelp is killing you"** — 2.5 stars with 4 reviews after 15 years in business. Every lost lead that checks Yelp is going to a competitor.

2. **"You're not on any 'Best of Memphis' lists"** — Despite calling yourself "Memphis's Best Roofers," you don't appear on Expertise.com (you were in 2022), Angi Top 10, or HomeGuide Top 10. These lists drive leads.

3. **"Your BBB profile has an unanswered complaint"** — That's dragging you to B- while competitors like Masters Roofing have A+. Takes 10 minutes to resolve.

4. **"Gmail for business contact?"** — gmancrocker@gmail.com as your business email looks unprofessional. Should be @roofmd.com.

5. **"Your schema is actually solid"** — You have RoofingContractor and FAQPage markup, which most competitors don't. But you're not leveraging it because your review signals are so weak.

## Recommended Obieo Services

Based on this audit, recommend:

| Service | Why | Priority |
|---------|-----|----------|
| **Local SEO / Reputation Management** | Review volume is critically low. Need a review generation strategy and Yelp/BBB cleanup. | 🔴 High |
| **GEO Optimization** | Has good schema foundation but content isn't AI-citable. Need to make their expertise quotable. | 🟡 Medium |
| **Content Strategy** | Needs blog/educational content around their differentiators (21-point inspection, Dr. Leaky concept). | 🟡 Medium |
| **Local Landing Pages** | 15 service areas listed but likely no dedicated pages. Programmatic SEO opportunity. | 🟡 Medium |

**Pitch angle:** "You've built a solid business with real certifications (GAF Master Elite), but your online reputation doesn't reflect it. A 2.5 Yelp rating and B- BBB are costing you leads every day. Let's fix that."
