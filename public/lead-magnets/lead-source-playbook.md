## Introduction: Why I'm Sharing This

Every home service business owner hits the same wall.

You've got a solid crew. Your close rate is decent. Customers are happy. But growth has flatlined because you simply can't get enough quality leads through the door.

I know this because I've lived it. Running Lapeyre Roofing, I've tested every lead source imaginable. I've wasted money on platforms that promised the world. I've found hidden gems that most contractors overlook. And over years of tracking every dollar, I've developed a system that consistently generates leads at a fraction of what my competitors pay.

This isn't theory I picked up at a conference. This is the exact framework I use in my own business and teach to every Obieo client. It's battle-tested across roofing, HVAC, plumbing, and dozens of home service verticals.

This playbook breaks down the complete system: how to evaluate lead sources, track real numbers, and make decisions based on math instead of gut feelings. It's the same approach that's helped my clients cut their cost per acquisition by 40% or more.

## Part 1: The Lead Source Hierarchy

Not all leads are created equal. Here's the breakdown of every major lead source, ranked from cheapest to most expensive per appointment based on my experience and data from Obieo clients.

### Tier 1: Aggregators

**Cost per lead:** $10-90
**Typical set rate:** 10-15%
**Best for:** High-volume operations with fast response systems

Aggregators like HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, and similar platforms sell the same lead to multiple contractors. You're competing against 3-5 other companies who got the same notification you did.

> **The Speed-to-Lead Reality**
>
> If you can't respond within 60 seconds, don't waste money on aggregators. The first company to call wins 78% of the time. That means dedicated staff, automated systems, or you're lighting money on fire.

**The math:** At $50/lead with a 12% set rate, your cost per appointment is roughly $417. That only works if your average ticket is high enough to absorb it.

**When aggregators work:**
- You have someone whose only job is answering leads instantly
- Your CRM can auto-dial within seconds of lead receipt
- You're testing a new market before committing bigger dollars

---

### Tier 2: Exclusive Leads

**Cost per lead:** $120-500
**Typical set rate:** 25-35%
**Best for:** Companies wanting better quality without the speed pressure

"Exclusive" means you're the only contractor who receives that lead. In theory. The reality is murkier.

> **Warning: "Exclusive" Doesn't Always Mean Exclusive**
>
> Some providers sell "exclusive" leads that are only exclusive within their platform. The same homeowner might be on three different lead platforms, getting calls from six different contractors. Always ask: "Is this exclusive to your platform, or exclusive period?"

The legitimate exclusive lead providers can be worth the premium. Higher contact rates, less competition, and homeowners who are actually expecting your call.

**Key questions to ask any exclusive lead provider:**
1. How do you verify the lead is exclusive?
2. What's your average contact rate?
3. Do you offer any guarantees?
4. Can I see anonymized data from similar contractors?

---

### Tier 3: Live Transfers

**Cost per lead:** $175-230
**Typical appointment rate:** 60-80%
**Best for:** Companies that need appointments now and can afford the premium

Live transfers are the luxury tier of paid leads. A call center qualifies the homeowner, confirms interest, and then transfers them directly to your sales team while they're still on the phone.

> **The Live Transfer Advantage**
>
> When someone is already on a call and gets transferred, the psychological commitment is different. They've already invested time. They're expecting to talk. Close rates on live transfers typically run 15-25% higher than cold lead follow-ups.

**Cost per appointment calculation:**
- At $200/transfer with 70% actually scheduling, you're paying ~$285 per appointment
- Compare that to aggregators at $417 per appointment (from earlier example)
- The "expensive" option is actually cheaper per appointment

This is why you have to run the numbers. Sticker price means nothing.

---

### Tier 4: PPC and Paid Social

**Cost per lead:** Highly variable ($75-400)
**Set rate:** 20-40%
**Best for:** Companies willing to invest in learning and optimization

Pay-per-click (Google Ads) and paid social (Facebook/Instagram) give you control that third-party leads never will. You own the system. You control the targeting. Over time, you can optimize performance in ways that aren't possible with lead providers.

The catch: there's a learning curve.

> **The 90-Day Reality Check**
>
> Plan to lose money for the first 90 days of any PPC or paid social campaign. The algorithms need data. Your ads need testing. Your landing pages need optimization. If you can't stomach 90 days of negative ROI while the system learns, these channels aren't for you.

**What I've found works with PPC:**
- Start with a modest budget ($2,000-5,000/month)
- Don't touch settings for the first 30 days
- Make one change at a time after that
- Expect 4 months to break even, 6-7 months to be profitable

### Tier 5: SEO and Organic Traffic

**Cost per lead:** Essentially $0 ongoing
**Set rate:** 40-60%
**Best for:** Companies thinking long-term who want the highest ROI

SEO is the anomaly on this list. It's the highest-ROI lead source available, but it requires patience most business owners don't have.

> **Why Organic Leads Convert Better**
>
> When someone types "roof replacement near me" into Google and clicks on your organic listing, they're actively searching. No one sold them. No one transferred them. They found you because they were looking. These leads have 3-4x higher intent than any paid source.

**The SEO reality:**
- Takes 90+ days minimum to see meaningful results
- More like 6-12 months for significant traffic in competitive markets
- But once rankings are established, leads cost nearly nothing
- Compounds over time (the "snowball effect")

Think of SEO like hiring an employee who works 24/7, never takes sick days, and costs you nothing after the initial training period. That's what a well-optimized website does.

This is why I built Obieo around SEO. I'll break down the full argument in Part 4.

## Part 2: The Math Framework

Stop guessing. Start calculating. Here's the exact framework I use at Lapeyre Roofing and teach to every Obieo client.

### The Core Formulas

**Formula 1: Cost Per Appointment**
```
Cost Per Appointment = Lead Cost / Set Rate
```

**Formula 2: Cost Per Sale**
```
Cost Per Sale = Cost Per Appointment / Close Rate
```

**Formula 3: Marketing Efficiency**
```
Marketing Cost % = Total Ad Spend / Revenue Generated
```

---

### The Real-World Example

Let's run the numbers on a typical scenario:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lead cost | $200 |
| Set rate | 40% |
| Close rate | 20% (1 in 5 appointments) |
| Average ticket | $20,000 |
| Gross margin | 30% |

**Step 1: Cost per appointment**
$200 / 0.40 = **$500 per appointment**

**Step 2: Cost per sale**
$500 / 0.20 = **$2,500 per sale**

**Step 3: Profit analysis**
- Revenue: $20,000
- Gross profit (30%): $6,000
- Customer acquisition cost: $2,500
- Net profit after marketing: $3,500

**Step 4: Marketing efficiency**
$2,500 / $20,000 = **12.5% of revenue**

> **The Target Range**
>
> I tell my clients to keep marketing costs between 10-15% of revenue. Below 10% might mean you're under-investing in growth. Above 15% and margins start getting squeezed.

### Comparative Analysis

Here's how different sources stack up using real numbers from my experience:

| Source | Lead Cost | Set Rate | Close Rate | Cost/Sale | Marketing % |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Aggregator | $50 | 12% | 20% | $2,083 | 10.4% |
| Exclusive | $250 | 30% | 22% | $3,788 | 18.9% |
| Live Transfer | $200 | 70% | 25% | $1,143 | 5.7% |
| PPC (optimized) | $150 | 35% | 22% | $1,948 | 9.7% |
| SEO/Organic | ~$0 | 50% | 30% | ~$0 | ~0% |

*Note: Numbers are illustrative. Your market, service, and operations will vary.*

The table reveals why the "expensive" options often aren't expensive at all. Live transfers at $200 actually deliver the lowest cost per sale of any paid source.

## Part 3: The Operational Playbook

Numbers only matter if you act on them. Here are the operational practices I've developed that separate contractors who scale from contractors who stagnate.

### Practice 1: Weekly Lead Source Reviews

> **"What Gets Measured Gets Improved"**
>
> Schedule 30 minutes every week to review lead performance. Not monthly. Not "when you get around to it." Weekly. Put it on the calendar. Protect it like a customer appointment.

**Your weekly review should cover:**
- Leads received by source
- Contact rate by source
- Appointments set by source
- Cost per appointment by source
- Any patterns or anomalies

This single habit has been one of the biggest factors in growing Lapeyre Roofing. We catch problems early and double down on what works before competitors notice.

---

### Practice 2: Active Lead Provider Management

Lead quality degrades without supervision. It's like subcontractors they start strong, then standards slip.

**What active management looks like:**
- Call your rep monthly (not just when there's a problem)
- Share your data with them (contact rates, set rates)
- Ask them to review underperforming leads
- Request credits for bad leads immediately
- Get all guarantees in writing before you start

> **Negotiation Tip**
>
> Newer lead companies are often more flexible on pricing. They're building their contractor network and need success stories. Ask to set your own price per lead. The worst they can say is no.

---

### Practice 3: Technology as Non-Negotiable

In 2026, manual lead management is a competitive disadvantage.

**The minimum tech stack:**
- CRM with lead source tracking
- API integration with lead providers
- Automated follow-up sequences
- SMS verification on inbound leads
- Response time tracking

> **SMS Verification Matters**
>
> Leads with SMS-verified phone numbers are worth significantly more. It confirms a real person with a real number who opted in. Ask any lead provider about their verification process before signing.

---

### Practice 4: Goal Decomposition

Big annual goals are useless without weekly targets.

**The breakdown method:**

1. Start with your annual revenue goal
2. Divide by average ticket size = jobs needed
3. Divide by close rate = appointments needed
4. Divide by 50 weeks = weekly appointment target
5. Divide by set rate = weekly leads needed

**Example:**
- Annual goal: $5,000,000
- Average ticket: $15,000
- Jobs needed: 334
- Close rate: 25%
- Appointments needed: 1,336
- Weekly appointments: 27
- Set rate: 30%
- Weekly leads needed: 90

Now you have a number you can actually manage to. If you're getting 90 leads this week, you're on track. If not, you know immediately.

## Part 4: The Case for SEO

I saved this for last because it's the most important and the most overlooked. It's also why I started Obieo.

Every paid lead source has the same fundamental problem: when you stop paying, the leads stop coming. SEO is different.

### The Five Reasons SEO Wins Long-Term

**1. Highest-Quality Leads**

Outside of Local Service Ads (LSA), SEO delivers the highest-intent leads in the industry. These are people actively searching for your service. They've already decided they need help. They're just deciding who to call.

**2. Highest ROI**

Once your website ranks, the ongoing cost to maintain those rankings is minimal. Compare that to PPC where you're paying for every single click, forever.

**3. Evergreen Asset**

Content you create today can generate leads for years. A well-written service page or blog post keeps working long after you've forgotten about it.

**4. Near-Zero Marginal Cost**

Lead #1 costs the same as lead #1,000 essentially nothing. With paid sources, your costs scale linearly with growth. With SEO, they don't.

**5. Compounding Returns**

SEO has a snowball effect. Rankings improve content authority. Authority improves other rankings. The longer you invest, the wider the gap between you and competitors who haven't.

> **The Catch**
>
> None of this happens fast. Plan for 90 days minimum to see early results. Plan for 6-12 months to see significant ROI. Plan for 2+ years to dominate your local market. The companies who win at SEO are the ones willing to invest before they see the payoff.

This is why I tell every contractor: start SEO now, even if you're relying on paid leads today. The sooner you plant the seed, the sooner you can stop paying for every single lead.

## Your Action Checklist

Stop reading. Start doing. Here's exactly what to implement this week:

- [ ] **Block 2 hours this week** for lead source analysis and strategy. Put it on your calendar now.

- [ ] **Calculate your cost per appointment** for every active lead source using the formulas in Part 2.

- [ ] **Set up a weekly tracking system** even if it's just a spreadsheet. Track: leads, contact rate, set rate, and cost per appointment by source.

- [ ] **Review your worst-performing source** this week. Either fix it or cut it.

- [ ] **Call each lead provider** and ask about guarantees, set rates, and what data they can share.

- [ ] **Calculate your weekly appointment target** using the goal decomposition method. Know your number.

- [ ] **Evaluate your SEO situation.** When's the last time you updated your website? What do you rank for? What could you rank for?

- [ ] **Get API integrations** if any leads are coming in via email or portal instead of directly into your CRM.

---

## The Bottom Line

The contractors who scale aren't the ones with the biggest ad budgets. They're the ones who know their numbers, review them weekly, and make decisions based on math instead of marketing pitches.

Lead generation isn't magic. It's math, systems, and consistent execution.

This is the exact playbook I use. Now it's yours.
