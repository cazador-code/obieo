# Personal Codex Notes (hunterlapeyre)

This folder is intentionally simple: small, reusable artifacts that help Codex (and Future You) move faster with less context switching.

What to keep here:
- `memory.md`: durable learnings about this repo (commands, patterns, gotchas).
- `runbooks/`: step-by-step procedures for recurring tasks.
- `checklists/`: safety rails for risky work (deploys, experiments, migrations).
- `prompts/`: prompts that consistently produce good agent behavior.
- `snippets/`: tiny scripts/queries you reuse (keep them small and documented).

Suggested habit:
At the end of a session, ask Codex to:
- append to `memory.md` (what it learned + what to do next time),
- create/update a runbook if it repeated a workflow,
- add a checklist item if it found a new failure mode.
