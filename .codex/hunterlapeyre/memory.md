# Codex Memory (obieo)

Use this file as durable, repo-specific “muscle memory”. Keep it concise and actionable.

## Working Agreements
- Prefer smallest change that is testable.
- Always leave a “how to verify” trail: exact commands, files, and expected output.
- Ask for a second opinion before merging anything risky (migrations, auth, billing, analytics, SEO changes).

## Repo Quickstart
- Install deps: `npm install`
- Dev server: `npm run dev`

## Common Commands
- Search (fallback when `rg` is unavailable): `grep -RIn "pattern" .`
- Find files: `find . -maxdepth 4 -type f -name "foo*"`
